# CS-305_Software-Security

# Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and its software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did the company want you to address?
# What did you do well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall well-being?
Artemis Financial is a financial institution handling sensitive customer data through its web-based software. The client required a security assessment to identify vulnerabilities and implement secure communication, encryption, and protection measures to prevent unauthorized data access.

# Which part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
I thoroughly examined potential threats, identified specific vulnerabilities, and proposed relevant security measures, including secure coding practices and encryption techniques.

# How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?
I added layers through encryption, secure API interactions, and input validation. In the future, I would continue using automated scanning tools alongside manual code reviews and implement regular security audits.

# How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
I conducted unit testing and static analysis to validate security improvements. After refactoring, I re-ran security tests and reviewed potential new vulnerabilities to confirm no additional risks were introduced.

# What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
I used tools like dependency checkers and followed secure coding practices (e.g., parameterized queries, secure password storage) to ensure data safety.

# Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?
I would showcase my approach to identifying and remediating security issues, along with examples of secure coding, dependency management, and encryption strategies, which highlight my focus on software security.
